# Desperados III Mods

Collection of my mods for the game Desperados III.

You can find me @1vader on the official [Desperados III](https://discord.gg/gDFNGzx) and [Mimimi](https://discord.gg/69ZxNTu) Discord servers for bug reports or ideas for improvements or new mods. Or you can just create and issue here.

## Mods Overview

- **Convinience**: Gives the options to auto-mute the game when in the background and starting levels on full zoom level and/or with highlights enabled.
- **D1CooperGun**: Makes Cooper's gun work more like in Desperados 1. The two guns now work like one, together having six quick shots after which a long reload is required. You have infinite reloads and can still use double shot. All the parameters (reload ammo and reload time) are tunable.
- **DevKillsList**: Shows you which devs you still need to kill for the Veteran Bounty Hunter achievement.
- **ExtendedCheats**: Collection of random cheats like infinite ammo or modifying ability ranges.
- **KingsmanEasterEgg**: Allows you to modify the chance that a snipe with Doc will trigger the [exploding heads easter egg](https://desperados.fandom.com/wiki/Desperados_III_Easter_Eggs#Exploding_Heads). Usually the chance for this is 0.1% so most people will probably never see it without this.
- **ShowdownModePauseOnDesperadoDiff**: Allows you to enable pausing Showdown mode on Desperado difficulty.
